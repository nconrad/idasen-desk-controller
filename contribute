Hi nconrad,
I absolutely hate the original Idasen app, our world would be better without it. 
So I found your repo and would be happy to contribute to your project! As i dont want to just do random stuff with a fork,
it would be cool if we can align somehow, for what features would be cool? My email is pascal<dot>sokal<at>gmail<dot>com.

Regards 
Pascal
